This repository is dedicated to my exercises using ggplot2 in R. 
I did a basic but very effective online course in data visualisation, as part of a data science course. 
It's where I encountered ggplot2 and the "Grammar of Graphics".

I'm exploring ggplot2 further and this is where I store my play files. Each script file has a corresponding, saved chart output in PNG format.
